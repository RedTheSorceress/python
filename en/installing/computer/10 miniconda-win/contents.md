# Step 1: Miniconda

This package can be downloaded from the [Anaconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). [The Windows 64-bit version can be found here.](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe)

As soon as the download is finished execute the downloaded file. Follow the installation instructions and choose to install for "Just Me" where you can.

**Tick all four boxes in the "advanced installation options"! Especially the "Add Miniconda3 to my PATH environment variable" is important. If you did not tick this box, you have to reinstall Miniconda!** Keep in mind that this menu can look slightly different for everyone.

The installation might take a while.
