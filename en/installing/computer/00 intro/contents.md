# Python on your own computer

To be able to program on your own computer you will need a couple different programs:

1. **Miniconda**, a version of Python that is easy to install.

2. **Pulsar**, an *editor* to write code in. This is, in a way, just a text writing program, but specifically meant for programming code. For example, it highlights particular parts of your code in specific colors, so you can more easily distinguish which part of your code does what.

3. A *command line interface* from which we will provide you with methods to start and interact with your programs. macOS comes with one!
