# Step 2: Pulsar

This program can be downloaded from the [Pulsar website](https://pulsar-edit.dev/download.html#regular-releases). Select your operating system and download the installer. Once again you will have to execute the downloaded file. This time though, you do not have to alter any settings during the installation process.
