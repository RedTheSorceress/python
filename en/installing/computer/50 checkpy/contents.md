# Step 5: Checking `checkpy` and downloading tests

To help you verify whether a program functions in compliance with the specifications of an assignment, we have written a program of our own called **checkpy**. This program was installed in our environment in the previous steps. In addition to `checkpy` we also need the tests that correspond to the assignments that you'll have to make. These tests can be downloaded by executing the following command in the terminal:

    checkpy -d spcourse/tests

To test whether your installation of `checkpy` was successful you can test `hello.py`, which we have written earlier in these installation instructions. Navigate to the folder that holds `hello.py` and execute the following command:

    checkpy hello

Do you only see happy smileys? That means you've done a-okay, and that you've met our requirements for the assignment! Should there still be some sad smileys, no worries! Carefully examine your code and verify it with each of the specifications. And don't forget you can always send us an email if you're stuck.
