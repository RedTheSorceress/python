# Design challenge: improving football_analysis.py

On the "Learn to analyse and process a dataset" practice-page you have copied and pasted a program that can calculate the total number of goals van Basten has made for his club and find in which seasons van Basten scored more than 20 goals. The program does everything in a single loop, which leads to minimal code, but makes it more difficult to reuse parts for different but similar data analysis that we could want to do with the data. In `temperature.py` you have done a similar set of tasks, but separated the different "phases" of the program into functions.

As an exercise in design, try to think of ways to improve this program, but not change its functionality. Code design is very difficult to learn, and requires thinking and rewriting code, so try to find another student to discuss with!

*If you do not have time for this exercise, or do not know how to approach it, you are allowed to skip it. However, this is also a great opportunity to show your understanding of the design concepts of this week!*
