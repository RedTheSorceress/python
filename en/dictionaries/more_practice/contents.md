# More dictionary practice

> **You don’t have to hand in these practice exercises.** They’re here for you to test yourself. Did you fully understand the theory you just learned?
>
> If there is an exercise that you don’t know how to solve, review the theory again. If that doesn’t help, discuss the exercise with another student and/or the teacher.

To provide you with a solid understanding of the use of dictionaries, we have written a couple of exercises that are closer to how dictionaries are used in practice. As you work through these practical examples, you will gain confidence in your ability to use dictionaries to solve real-world problems, and you will develop the skills and intuition needed to create efficient and effective solutions.
