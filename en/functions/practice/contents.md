# Practice with functions
> **You don't have to hand in these practice exercises.** They're here for you to test yourself. Did you fully understand the theory you just learned?

> If there is an exercise that you don't know how to make, review the theory again. If that doesn't help, discuss the exercise with another student and/or the teacher.


Create a file called `functions.py` to work in.

**Exercise 1** Create a function `half` that accepts one number and returns that number divided by 2. So,

    # your code here

    x = 4
    y = 3
    a = half(x)
    b = half(y)

    print(a, b)

should print

    2.0 1.5

**Exercise 2** Create a function `mean` that returns the mean between two numbers. So,

    # your code here

    x = mean(4, 6)
    print(x)

should print

    5.0

**Exercise 3** Create a function `max` that takes two numbers and returns the maximum of the two. So,

    # your code here

    x = 4
    y = 18
    z1 = max(x, y)
    z2 = max(y, x)

    print(z1, z2)

should print

    18 18

**Exercise 4** Create a function `maxx` that takes three numbers and returns the maximum. (If you're clever, you can do this by calling the function `max` from the previous exercise twice inside the function `maxx`)

**Exercise 5** Create a function `my_sum` that takes a list and computes the sum of its elements. So,

    my_list = [1,2,3,4]
    s = my_sum(my_list)
    print(s)

should print

    10

**Exercise 1**

    def half(val):
        c = val / 2
        return c

    x = 4
    y = 3
    a = half(x)
    b = half(y)

    print(a, b)

**Exercise 2**

    def mean(a, b):
        c = (a + b) / 2
        return c

    x = mean(4, 6)
    print(x)

**Exercise 3**

    def max(a, b):
        if a < b:
            return b
        else:
            return a

    x = 4
    y = 18
    z1 = max(x, y)
    z2 = max(y, x)

    print(z1, z2)

**Exercise 4**

    def maxx(a, b, c):
        max1 = max(a, b)
        max2 = max(max1, c)
        return max2

    m = maxx(1, 9, 4)
    print(m)

**Exercise 5**

    def my_sum(lst):
        acc = 0
        for number in lst:
            acc += number
        return acc

    my_list = [1,2,3,4]
    s = my_sum(my_list)
    print(s)
