# Practice with algorithms
> **You don't have to hand in these practice exercises.** They're here for you to test yourself. Did you fully understand the theory you just learned?
>
> If there is an exercise that you don't know how to make, review the theory again. If that doesn't help, discuss the exercise with another student and/or the teacher.

Test your understanding with the following practice exercises. Create a file called `algorithms.py` for your solutions.

**Exercise 1** Write an if-statement that checks if the value of the variable `x` is lower than 50. If this is the case, print "foo", else print "bar".

    x = 12
    # your code here

**Exercise 2** Write an if-statement that checks if the value of variable `x` is lower than the value of variable `y`. If this is the case, add the value `5` to `y`, else set `y` to `0`

    x = 9
    y = 10
    # your code here

    print(y)

**Exercise 3** The height of a fine for speeding with a car in The Netherlands depends on how much faster than the limit you're going. On the highway the fines are given in the table below.

Highway fines in The Netherlands (2020):

| speed (exceeding limit)  | fine |
| ------------------------ | ---- |
| 5 km/h                   | 30 euros |
| 10 km/h                  | 64 euros |
| 20 km/h                  | 174 euros |
| 25 km/h                  | 232 euros |

Write a program that prints how high the fine is given the value of the variables `speed` and `limit` below. Of course, the code should also work correctly for different values of `speed` and `limit`

    speed = 120
    limit = 100
    # your code here

**Exercise 4** The code below is repeated from the video. It asks the user to enter their age. If the age is below 18 or the age is 65 or above, the user gets a discount to the museum.

Now, the museum changed its policy: children below 12 can enter the museum for free. Adapt the code such that if the age is below 12, it will print the text "Free entrance!" instead of "You receive a discount at the museum."

    user_input = input('What is your age? ')
    age = int(user_input)

    if age < 18 or age >= 65:
        print("You receive a discount at the museum.")
    else:
        print("No discount.")

**Exercise 5** We continue with the code from 1.1. Students will also receive a discount. Ask the user for a second input with the question: "Are you a student (y/[n])?". If the student answers "y" or "yes", make sure the message "You receive a discount at the museum." is printed instead of "No discount.", regardless of the age.

**Exercise 1**

    x = 12
    if x < 50:
        print('foo')
    else:
        print('bar')

**Exercise 2**

    x = 9
    y = 10
    if x < y:
        y += 5
    else:
        y = 0

**Exercise 3**

    speed = 120
    limit = 100

    if speed - limit > 25:
    print('Your fine is 232 euros.')
    elif speed - limit > 20:
    print('Your fine is 174 euros.')
    elif speed - limit > 10:
    print('Your fine is 64 euros.')
    elif speed - limit > 5:
    print('Your fine is 30 euros.')

**Exercise 4**

    user_input = input('What is your age? ')
    age = int(user_input)

    if age < 12:
        print("Free entrance!")
    elif age < 18 or age >= 65:
        print("You receive a discount at the museum.")
    else:
        print("No discount.")

**Exercise 5**

    user_input = input('What is your age? ')
    is_student = input('Are you a student (y/[n])? ')
    age = int(user_input)

    if age < 12:
        print("Free entrance!")
    elif age < 18 or age >= 65 or is_student == 'y' or is_student == 'yes':
        print("You receive a discount at the museum.")
    else:
        print("No discount.")
