# Practice with for-loops
> **You don't have to hand in these practice exercises.** They're here for you to test yourself. Did you fully understand the theory you just learned?
>
> If there is an exercise that you don't know how to make, review the theory again. If that doesn't help, discuss the exercise with another student and/or the teacher.

Test your understanding with the following practice exercises. Create a file called `for-loops.py` for your solutions.

## Exercises

**Exercise 1** Write a for-loop that prints the numbers 1 to 50.

**Exercise 2** Write a for-loop that prints the numbers between 1 and 50 with steps of 2.

**Exercise 3** Write a for-loop that loops over the numbers 0 to 100 with steps of 4 and adds them all together. Print the result.
