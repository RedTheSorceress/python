# Practice with while-loops
> **You don't have to hand in these practice exercises.** They're here for you to test yourself. Did you fully understand the theory you just learned?
>
> If there is an exercise that you don't know how to make, review the theory again. If that doesn't help, discuss the exercise with another student and/or the teacher.

Test your understanding with the following practice exercises. Create a file called `while-loops.py` for your solutions.

## While-loop exercises
**Exercise 1** Write a while-loop that continues dividing the variable `s` until the result is 1. Print the value of s at every iteration.

    s = 128
    # your code here

**Exercise 2** Based on the code of the previous exercise. Introduce a second variable called `i` that counts how many iterations the while-loop runs. Print the resulting value of `i` after the loop is done.

## For/while exercises
**Exercise 3** Consider the following piece of code:

    for i in range(1, 5, 2):
        print(i)

Rewrite this piece of code such that the behavior stays the same, but it uses a while-loop instead of a for.

**Exercise 4**
Consider the following piece of code:

    x = 2
    while x < 12:
        print(x)
        x += 3

Rewrite this such that the behavior stays the same, but it uses a for-loop instead of a while.

**Exercise 1**

    s = 128
    while s > 1:
        s /= 2
        print(s)

**Exercise 2**

    s = 128
    i = 0
    while s > 1:
        s /= 2
        i += 1
        print(s)
    print(i)

**Exercise 3**

    i = 1
    while i < 5:
        print(i)
        i += 2

**Exercise 4**

    for x in range(2, 12, 3):
        print(x)
