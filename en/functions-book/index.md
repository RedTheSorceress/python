## Programming Basics book

To further aid you in practicing with functions, we have created an [excerpt of the Programming Basics book on functions](book_en.pdf).

The idea in the book is that every sub-chapter consists of two pages; one page with exercises, and one page with an in-depth explanation. We advise you to open the book in a two-page view. If you already have some experience with calculations in programming languages, be sure to do the last few exercises of every page. Otherwise, make exercises until you think you can do it without making _any_ mistakes. Check if your answer is indeed correct! Answers to all the exercises are in the back of the book.
